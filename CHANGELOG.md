### Added

- redirection HTTP code allows for 307 and 308

### Changed

- use [seablast/logger](https://github.com/WorkOfStan/seablast-logger), a [PSR-3](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/) compliant logger with verbosity control, as a logger for Tracy.
- following SQL statements are not logged: DESCRIB, DO, EXPLAIN as they do not change the table data

## [0.2.3.5] - 2024-06-09

PHPUnit tests ready

### Added

- SeablastMysqli::queryStrict throws DbmsException in case of SQL statement failure
- SeablastController::getIdentity to provide access to user identity

### Changed

- SeablastController::applyConfiguration divided to part called only once before session starts, and part that can be called repeatedly (e.g. for PHPUnit)

## [0.2.3.4] - 2024-05-30

### Added

- SeablastConstant::SB_PHINX_ENVIRONMENT to override `$phinx['environments']['default_environment']`

### Changed

- use `Seablast\Interfaces\IdentityManagerInterface;` instead of `Seablast\Seablast\IdentityManagerInterface;`
- GitHub workflows uses WorkOfStan/seablast-actions instead of WorkOfStan/MyCMS
- query.log generated by SeablastMysqli is rotating, i.e. query_YYYY-MM.log; includes timestamp and is generated by error_log

### Removed

- table prefix (phinx) no more available through SB:phinx:table_prefix (only via `configuration->dbmsTablePrefix()`)

## [0.2.3.3] - 2024-03-30

- Changed: throw specific Exceptions
- Fixed: UNDER_CONSTRUCTION excludes localhost
- PHP/8.0, PHP/8.1 and PHP/8.2 tested automatically by GitHub for Composer validity and PHPStan

## [0.2.3.2] - 2024-03-09

### Added

- SeablastConstant::APP_MAPPING_401 mapping to use in case of authentication required (instead of HTTP code 401)

## [0.2.3.1] - 2024-03-05

### Fixed

- SeablastConfiguration::getArrayInt

## [0.2.3] - 2024-03-03

### Added

- table prefix (phinx) available through SB:phinx:table_prefix OR dbmsTablePrefix()
- SeablastConfiguration contains SeablastConstant::USER_ID and SeablastConstant::USER_GROUPS
- SB_CHARSET_DATABASE to mysqli::set_charset
- IdentityManagerInterface expects also user ID and list of groups **BREAKING CHANGE**

### Changed

- using the documented double pipe `||` as a logical OR operator in composer.json (instead of the older single pipe operator)

### Removed

- SeablastConfiguration::optionsBool as redundant (use flag instead)

## [0.2.2] - 2024-02-18

### Changed

- ErrorModel to display the HTTP errors nicely. User friendly HTTP error messages.

## [0.2.1] - 2024-02-03

### Added

- `SeablastConstant::SB_SMTP_` default parameters
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): SB_IDENTITY_MANAGER provided by application MUST have methods prescribed in IdentityManagerInterface, these populate FLAG_USER_IS_AUTHENTICATED and USER_ROLE_ID.
- Access to a Route can be restricted to certain roles.
- httpCode>=400 in the model response triggers views/error.latte

### Changed

- Starting a session requires more complex initialization, so Tracy starts immediately (so that it can handle any errors that occur) and then the session handler is initialized and finally Tracy is informed that the session is ready to be used.

### Removed

- Model response params->redirection changed to params->redirectionUrl

### Security

- configuration->exists catches all property types separately
- The session.cookie_secure directive expects a boolean value. When you're using ini_set, you can set it to '1' or 'On' to enable it, or '0' or 'Off' to disable it. PHP will correctly interpret both '1' and 'On' as true, and both '0' and 'Off' as false. However, it's generally a good practice to use '1' for true and '0' for false when setting boolean ini values with ini_set, as this is more explicit and less likely to cause confusion.

## [0.2] - 2024-01-27

### Added

- show HTTP code error Tracy BarPanel
- /api/error for is always available (if not overriden): Log errors reported by Ajax saved to the standard error log

### Changed **BREAKING**

- SeablastModel->getParameters() returns object: no more option to return array<mixed>
- use plural in directories: Exceptions, `Apis`.
- templates folder renamed to views
- model result property `status` renamed to the self-explaining `httpCode`

### Security

- symfony/security-csrf component generates CSRF tokens (always checked if GenericRestApiJsonModel is extended)

## [0.1.1] - 2024-01-12

### Added

- class Api\GenericRestApiJsonModel implements SeablastModelInterface
- Exception\UploadException to translate (int) code to (string) message
- class Api\ApiErrorModel to be directly used by application
- JSON response uses `status` property as a response HTTP code.

### Changed

- improved SeablastMysqli error logging

### Fixed

- more ways to identify HTTPS from SERVER headers

## [0.1] - 2023-12-30

- MVC architecture
- SeablastConstant class for IDE hinting
- added SeablastSetup to combine configuration files into a valid configuration before starting Tracy/Debugger and then Controller

- GET parameters passed to model in configuration fields SB_GET_ARGUMENT_ID|SB_GET_ARGUMENT_CODE
- SeablastModelInterface.php to define minimal requirements for a model used by SeablastModel
- SeablastModel uses permanent argument Superglobals $superglobals (instead of injection `$m->setSuperglobals($superglobals);` if required by APP_MAPPING, so that it is always easily available)
- FLAG_DEBUG_JSON: Output JSON as HTML instead of application/json so that Tracy is displayed
- `declare(strict_types=1);` everywhere
